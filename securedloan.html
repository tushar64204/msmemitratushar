            <div class="details" id="about">
                <p>A secured loan is a loan provided to a business against collateral, such as property, equipment, or inventory. It offers lower interest rates, higher borrowing limits, and longer repayment terms compared to unsecured loans.</p>
                <h2>Secured Loan Benefits</h2>
    <p>A secured loan is a loan provided to businesses against any collateral, such as property, equipment, or inventory. Secured loans are cheaper, and have higher borrowing limits and longer repayment terms as compared to unsecured loans. Collateral is an asset, such as a home, plot, or other valuable property, that the lender can take possession of if the borrower fails to repay the loan according to the agreed terms. Secured loans are considered less risky for lenders because they have a form of security, which often results in lower interest rates and more favorable terms for borrowers.</p>
    
    <h2>Benefits of Secured Loans</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Lower Interest Rates:</strong> Because the loan is backed by collateral, lenders perceive it as less risky. This typically results in lower interest rates compared to unsecured loans.</li>
        <li><strong>Higher Borrowing Limits:</strong> Secured loans generally allow for larger loan amounts compared to unsecured loans. This is because the collateral provides assurance to the lender that they can recover their funds even if the borrower defaults.</li>
        <li><strong>Longer Repayment Terms:</strong> Borrowers often enjoy longer repayment periods with secured loans, spreading out payments over a more extended period. This can help manage cash flow more effectively.</li>
        <li><strong>Easier Approval:</strong> Secured loans can be easier to qualify for, especially for borrowers with less-than-perfect credit histories. The collateral reduces the lender's risk, making them more willing to extend credit.</li>
        <li><strong>Improved Credit Terms:</strong> With secured loans, borrowers may find more flexible terms, such as adjustable repayment schedules or the ability to renegotiate terms if needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Potential Tax Benefits:</strong> In some cases, the interest paid on secured loans may be tax-deductible. This can provide additional financial benefits to borrowers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These benefits make secured loans a preferred choice for businesses and individuals looking to access larger amounts of capital with more favorable terms and conditions.</p>

    <h2>Types of Secured Business Loans</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Loan against Property:</strong> A loan against property, also known as a mortgage loan or a property-backed loan, is a type of secured loan where money is borrowed from a lender against a mortgage of property (such as a house, land, or commercial property) as collateral.</li>
        <li><strong>Gold Loan:</strong> A gold loan is a type of secured loan where the money is borrowed from a lender against gold jewelry, coins, or bars as collateral. The value of the loan is usually a percentage of the gold's market value.</li>
        <li><strong>Cash Credit/Overdraft Limit:</strong> CC/OD can be availed to manage the working capital of the business. The CC can be collateral.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Rate of Interest</h2>
    <p>Secured business loan interest rates range between 8.75% p.a. to 14% p.a. Depending on the loan amount availed by you, your credit score, and repayment tenure, the rate of interest on your loan is decided.</p>

            <div class="details" id="faq">
                <p><strong>Q: What is a secured loan?</strong></p>
                <p>A: A secured loan is backed by collateral, reducing risk for lenders and resulting in lower interest rates for borrowers.</p>
                <h2>FAQ</h2>
                <div class="faq-section">
                    <p class="faq-question">1. How do I know if the collateral is sufficient?</p>
                    <p class="faq-answer">For the lender to consider property/asset as collateral, the property/asset's current market value, as assessed by the lender, must be equal to or higher than the business loan you seek.</p>
            
                    <p class="faq-question">2. Is it mandatory to provide property as collateral?</p>
                    <p class="faq-answer">You need to provide collateral to get a secured business loan. However, you can provide equipment, machinery, stock, raw material, and other things as collateral if not land and property. You may have varied preferences in this regard.</p>
            
                    <p class="faq-question">3. Why should I provide collateral?</p>
                    <p class="faq-answer">The primary purpose of using collateral is to have some sort of assurance that the customer will repay the loan. If a customer fails to repay, the lender will have the right over the pledged asset/property and may sell it to recover the lost money. Since these loans may include vast sums of money, some sort of repayment guarantee is needed.</p>
            
                    <p class="faq-question">4. Will the collateral be immediately sold if I fail to pay an installment?</p>
                    <p class="faq-answer">In case you fail to make repayments on time continuously over a certain period, a protocol will be followed to remind you about the missing payments. If you fail to respond to the reminders, the lender will follow the set protocol of sending you a legal notice. Further, the case may be taken to the court of law or maybe auctioned based on the terms and conditions agreed upon at the time of loan disbursal.</p>
            
                    <p class="faq-question">5. If repayments are not made on time, does the lender take over all the proceedings from the sale of the collateral?</p>
                    <p class="faq-answer">If your property or asset is auctioned due to the failure of repayments, the lender will retain only the amount that you owe towards the loan repayment. In case of an excess received from the proceedings, it will be credited to your bank account.</p>
