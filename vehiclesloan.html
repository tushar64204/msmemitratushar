                <p>Vehicles loans provide funding for the purchase of new or used vehicles, including cars, trucks, and commercial vehicles.</p>
                <h2>About Vehicles Loan</h2>
                <p>A Vehicle Loan is a loan that allows borrowers to purchase two and four-wheelers for personal use. The borrower typically borrows a certain amount of money from a lender, which is then repaid over a predetermined period of time, usually with interest. The purchased vehicle is hypothecated with the lenders.</p>
                
                <h3>Rate of Interest</h3>
                <p>Vehicle loan interest rates range between 8.70% p.a. to 12% p.a. Depending on the loan amount availed by you, your credit score, and repayment tenure, the rate of interest on your loan is decided.</p>

            <div class="details" id="faq">
                <p><strong>Q: What is a vehicle loan?</strong></p>
                <p>A: A vehicle loan is a loan provided to finance the purchase of a new or used vehicle.</p>
                <h2>FAQ</h2>

                <h3>1. Do I need collateral for a Vehicle loan?</h3>
                <p>A vehicle loan is a loan granted to an individual/company interested in buying a Vehicle. Therefore a Vehicle loan is a secured loan where the Vehicle you buy acts as collateral. However, you do have to get the RC (registration certificate) of the car endorsed by the bank. This endorsement is canceled after repayment of the loan is completed.</p>
                
                <h3>2. What is the maximum amount of loan that I can avail?</h3>
                <p>The maximum loan amount approved may vary from one bank to the other bank. Usually, banks approve loan amounts that range from 80%-90% of the Vehicle's on-road price. In addition to these criteria, the percentage of financing offered depends on the price, type of car (standard/premium), and whether you are applying for a new or pre-owned car.</p>
                
                <h3>3. What is the typical tenure of a Vehicle loan?</h3>
                <p>The tenure of a Vehicle loan ranges from 1 year to 5 years. The shorter the loan tenure, the higher is the EMI payable and the reverse is true for longer car loan tenures.</p>
                
                <h3>4. Do I need a loan guarantor or co-borrower?</h3>
                <p>A loan guarantor or a co-borrower is only required if you are unable to meet the eligibility criteria stated by the lending institution such as monthly income, age, or credit score.</p>
                
                <h3>5. In which cases can my car loan application be rejected?</h3>
                <p>Your loan application may be rejected if you have a bad credit score, have defaulted on your repayments or applied for and been rejected for loans multiple times, etc. Also, you should meet the bank's eligibility criteria such as a minimum income level, age, previous relationship with the bank, etc. to get your loan approved.</p>
                
                <h3>6. Can I get financing for insurance and registration?</h3>
                <p>Vehicle loans do not cover the insurance or registration fees that you have to pay at the time of buying the vehicle. Vehicle insurance, which is mandatory, needs to be purchased separately and all vehicle registration-related costs also have to be borne by you as they are not covered by your Vehicle loan. However, there are few lenders that cover these costs under special schemes.</p>
                
                <h3>7. Can I pre-pay my Vehicle loan?</h3>
                <p>Pre-payment of Vehicle loans is allowed by many lenders however there are usually a few terms and conditions attached. For starters, the lenders only allow Vehicle loan repayment after you have completed specified loan tenure and there is usually a pre-payment penalty as well. It is recommended that you confirm all relevant charges with a bank before you make a pre-payment.</p>
                
                <h3>8. Can I sell my Vehicle before repayment of the Vehicle loan is completed?</h3>
                <p>No. Lenders who provide Vehicle loans will allow the vehicle to be sold to a new owner when the loan has been paid off in full. This is because you need to get a NOC from the lender before you can sell your vehicle and the document is released only after you have paid off the Vehicle loan in full.</p>
                
                <h3>9. How can I make my loan EMI payments?</h3>
                <p>Repayment of the loan can be done through post-dated cheques (PDC) provided by you to your lender when signing up for the Vehicle loan. The other option is an auto debit facility where the EMI is automatically debited from your savings/current account after you have provided an ECS (Electronic Clearing Service) mandate to the lender.</p>
